Example Code Explanation 
This is an example of one of the counters in this repository:

<!-- HTML structure for counter -->
<div class="counter" id="counter1">
    <span class="count">0</span>
</div>

<script>
// JavaScript to initiate counting on page reload
window.onload = function() {
    let count = 0;
    const counterElement = document.getElementById('counter1').querySelector('.count');
    const targetCount = 100; // Set the target count

    function updateCounter() {
        if (count < targetCount) {
            count++;
            counterElement.textContent = count;
            requestAnimationFrame(updateCounter);
        }
    }
    updateCounter();
};
</script>

Explanation:
- HTML Structure: Creates a div with the counter class, containing a span for displaying the count.
- JavaScript: Initiates counting when the page loads. The updateCounter function increments the counter until it reaches the target count.
